    "Feature extraction consists of using the representations learned by a previous network to extract interesting features from new samples. These features are then run through a new classifier, which is trained from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs used for image classification comprise two parts: they start with a series of pooling and convolution layers, and they end with a densely-connected classifier. The first part is called the **\"convolutional base\"** of the model. In the case of convnets, **\"feature extraction\"** will simply consist of taking the convolutional base of a previously-trained network, running the new data through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output.\n",

    "Why only reuse the convolutional base? Could we reuse the densely-connected classifier as well? In general, it should be avoided. The reason is simply that the representations learned by the convolutional base are likely to be more generic and therefore more reusable: the feature maps of a convnet are presence maps of generic concepts over a picture, which is likely to be useful regardless of the computer vision problem at hand. On the other end, the representations learned by the classifier will necessarily be very specific to the set of classes that the model was trained on -- they will only contain information about the presence probability of this or that class in the entire picture. Additionally, representations found in densely-connected layers no longer contain any information about where objects are located in the input image: these layers get rid of the notion of space, whereas the object location is still described by convolutional feature maps. For problems where object location matters, densely-connected features would be largely useless.\n",

    "When compiling the model, I choose **categorical_crossentropy** as the loss function (which is relevent for multiclass, single-label classification problem) and **Adam** optimizer.\n",
    "* The cross-entropy loss calculates the error rate between the predicted value and the original value. The formula for calculating cross-entropy loss is given [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy). Categorical is used because there are 10 classes to predict from. If there were 2 classes, I would have used binary_crossentropy.\n",
    "* The Adam optimizer is an improvement over SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent). The optimizer is responsible for updating the weights of the neurons via backpropagation. It calculates the derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight and subtracts it from the weight. That is how a neural network learns."
